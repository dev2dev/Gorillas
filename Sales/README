USAGE

    1. stats

    The script expects to find your sales data from iTunes Connect in
    subdirectories of where you're running `stats` from.

    NOTE:   `stats` expects to find uncompressed `.txt` files in these
            subdirectories.

    I recommend the format YYYY-MM for your subdirectory names.  This
    is also the format used by the `fetchdailies` script.

    As a guide, here's the layout of my sales data:

        2009-01
        2009-01/S_D_80071677_999998_20090117_20090118204458087.txt
        2009-01/S_D_80071677_999998_20090118_20090120081227529.txt
        ...
        2009-02
        2009-02/S_D_80071677_999998_20090201_20090205183120903.txt
        2009-02/S_D_80071677_999998_20090202_20090205183130102.txt
        ...

    Running `stats` will cause it to read in all your `.txt` files
    and compile some statistics on your sales history.

    `stats` can cope with multiple applications in your sales data, it will
    just ask you which application you'd like to compile a report for by
    presenting you with a menu of available application AppIDs.


    2. reviews

    The script contains an array of known AppIDs and AppStoreIDs.  Initially,
    this list will just contain my own application(s)' AppIDs and AppStoreIDs.
    You'll have to modify these arrays to add support or your own applications.

    Find the part (at the top) that says:

        ### MODIFY TO ADD SUPPORT FOR MORE APPLICATIONS
        appIds=(        "com.lyndir.lhunath.Gorillas"                           )
        appStoreIds=(   302275459                                               )
        ### END MODIFY

    Replace it by something like this:

        ### MODIFY TO ADD SUPPORT FOR MORE APPLICATIONS
        appIds=(        "com.mycompany.MyApplication"
                        "com.mycompany.MyOtherApplication"                      )
        appStoreIds=(   999999999
                        888888888                                               )
        ### END MODIFY

    Where `com.mycompany.MyApplication` is the AppID of your application as
    specified in the application's `Info.plist`, and `999999999` is the
    iTunes App Store ID of your application.  You can find this ID by looking
    at the iTunes App Store link for your application.  For instance, the
    iTunes App Store link for Gorillas is:
    
        http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=302275459&mt=8

    The App Store ID is the number after the `id=` part in this URL.

    After modifying the `reviews` script, you can run it to retrieve reviews
    for all known applications (all applications in the appIds array) from
    all countries with an iTunes App Store, or you can run it with the AppID
    of the application whose reviews you're interested in and it will only
    fetch the reviews for that application from all countries.  You can also
    specify a countryId as the second argument to only fetch reviews for that
    specific country.

    The latter is exactly what `stats` does at the end of its operation.  It
    runs the `reviews` script with the AppID you selected in its menu (or the
    only AppID available in your reports if there is only one) and retrieves
    all iTunes App Store reviews for the US iTunes App Store only.

    
    3. fetchdailies

    The script checks what the latest daily sales report is you have (again,
    relying on the fact that you've put them as uncompressed `.txt` files
    in subdirectories of where you're running `fetchdailies` from) and queries
    iTunes Connect to try and download all dailies since then.

    To configure it for use, you need to create a file in your home directory
    called `.appleid`.  This file should contain your AppleID and password.

    NOTE:   Make sure that the file is properly secured with permissions!

    The following code creates this file in a safe way, making sure only
    you can access the password within it:

        ( umask 177; vim ~/.appleid )

    That's assuming your editor is `vim`.  If you'd rather use `emacs`,
    `pico` or `nano`, replace `vim` in that command by your editor of choice.
    
    The file's contents should look like this (without the leading whitespace):

        lhunath
        mypassword

    The `fetchdailies` script will read your AppleID and password from this
    file when it's ran and pass it to the `appdailysales` script in a
    secure manner.

    The script is perfect for use in `crontab`.  Just add an entry that
    references the `fetchdailies` script, set to run every day at a certain
    hour.  For instance, I use the following crontab line to fetch my dailies
    every day at midnight:

        0 0 * * * ~/Documents/workspace/lyndir/Gorillas/Sales/fetchdailies

    NOTE:   You need to reference the script with its pathname.  Putting
            the directory that contains it in PATH is no good, because
            then the script won't be able to figure out where you keep
            it and your sales data.

    Of course, you can also run it manually (`./fetchdailies`) to quickly
    check iTunes Connect for any new reports.
